Build process:
  ☐ Typescript support
    ☐ Client & Server
      ✔ Webpack @done(19-06-26 00:13)
      ☐ Babel
        ☐ Learn how tsconfig influences babel build process
        ☐ Should output .mjs files (esnext modules)
      ☐ VS Code 
        ☐ ESLint
        ☐ Map alt:V typings
    ☐ UI (React.js)
      ☐ Custom webpack config (no create-react-app)
        For easier hot-reload integration in-game.
Prerequisites:
  ☐ Move UI from RAGE:MP project to alt:V
    Would be nice to test it while at it.
