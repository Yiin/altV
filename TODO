Build process:
  ☐ Typescript support
    ☐ Client & Server
      ✘ Webpack @cancelled(19-07-03 23:06)

        ✔ Learn how tsconfig influences babel build process @done(19-06-26 20:22)
        tsconfig.json determines how TypeScript does type checking. It also has some options affecting how TypeScript emits files, but since you're using babel instead, those don't apply. (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9028#issuecomment-439484274)
        ☐ Should output .mjs files (esnext modules)
      ☐ VS Code 
        ☐ ESLint
        ✔ Map alt:V typings @done(19-07-03 23:07)
    ☐ UI (React.js)
      ☐ Custom webpack config (no create-react-app)
        For easier hot-reload integration in-game.
Prerequisites:
  ☐ Move UI from RAGE:MP project to alt:V
    Would be nice to test it while at it.
